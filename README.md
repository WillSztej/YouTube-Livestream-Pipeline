# YouTube-Livestream-Pipeline
Program to livestream music on YouTube 24/7

This project is meant to help me gain experience in data processing/encoding for streaming video. After creating
a livestream event using the YouTube Data API, I want figure out how manually encode livestream data through the
API. I am planning to develop this project using Python3.
